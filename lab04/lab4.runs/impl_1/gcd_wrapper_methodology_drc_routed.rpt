2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.026 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.188 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.402 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.467 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.506 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[8]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning

There is a large setup violation of -10.519 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.664 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[9]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

There is a large setup violation of -9.423 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#9 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.919 ns between gcd_seq/b_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and gcd_seq/b_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uart_tx relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
